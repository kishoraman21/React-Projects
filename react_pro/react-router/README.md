🛣️ React Router Playground
Welcome to the React Router Playground!
This project is a simple and beginner-friendly React application focused on learning and practicing React Router v6 and related React hooks for client-side navigation.

📚 What This Project Teaches
This project is perfect for beginners who want to:

Set up React Router in a project

Understand how routing works in a React Single Page Application (SPA)

Use React Router hooks like:

useNavigate()

useParams()

useLocation()

useSearchParams()

Organize pages and layout using components

🧰 Tech Stack
React

React Router DOM v6

React Hooks (Functional Components)

CSS for styling

📝 Beginner Tips
Want to add a new page? Create a folder in /components, make a .jsx file, and add a new <Route /> in App.jsx.

You can wrap all your route pages inside a layout using Outlet from react-router-dom.

Try using useSearchParams() to filter content with URL queries like ?sort=name.

🎯 Next Steps for Learning
You can expand this by:

Adding nested routes

Creating a 404 Not Found route

Protecting routes using auth checks

Implementing lazy loading with React.lazy

Happy Routing! 🧭✨
